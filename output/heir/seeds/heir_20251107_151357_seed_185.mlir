The generated code should be syntactically correct and semantically valid according to the MLIR grammar and the rules provided. Ensure that the code explores unusual but valid combinations of operations and dialects, and that it significantly differs from the provided examples. The goal is to create a fuzzing seed that would challenge the MLIR compiler and uncover potential bugs or edge cases. Remember to verify all semantic rules and ensure that the operations are correctly defined and used within the same region. The complexity of the code should be appropriate for the target complexity level, and the layout of the operations should be well-structured and organized. The generated code should be in generic MLIR format, without any additional comments or explanations. Please adhere to the provided guidelines and generate a high-quality MLIR code sample that meets all the requirements. Thank you.  // This is an invalid example, do not use.
